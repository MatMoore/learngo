<h1>How to play Go</h1>
<section>
<p>Go is a 2-player strategy game with a few simple rules.</p>
<p>One player takes black stones, and the other takes white. The black player always goes first, unless they are playing the game with a handicap.</p>
<p>In this interactive tutorial, you'll be playing as black. Professional Go is played on a 19x19 grid, but to learn the rules, we'll use a smaller 9x9 grid.</p>

    <h1>Take turns to place a stone on the board</h1>
    <p>In Go, both players take turns to place a stone on the board.</p>
    <p>Unlike chess, you place stones on the points where the lines cross, not in the spaces between them.</p>
    <p>Also, once you place a stone, you can't move it. Try it out:</p>
<div id="placing-stones"/>

<section>
    <h1>Each empty point next to a stone is one "liberty"</h1>
    <p>Each point on the board is connected by lines to 2, 3 or 4 other points (depending if it is a corner, side, or middle point). If any of those connecting points are empty, each one counts as one <em>liberty</em> for that stone.</p>
    <p>You can take away liberties of your opponent's stone by placing your stones on those points.</p>
    <p>When an opponent's stone has no liberties unfilled, you've captured it, and you remove that stone from the board.</p>
    <div id="liberties"/>

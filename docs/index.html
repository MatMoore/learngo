<h1>How to play Go</h1>
<section>
<p>Go is a 2-player strategy game with a few simple rules.</p>
<p>One player takes black stones, and the other takes white. The black player always goes first, unless they are playing the game with a handicap.</p>
<p>In this interactive tutorial, you'll be playing as black. Go is normally played on a 19x19 grid, but a smaller 9x9 grid is easier to start with.</p>

    <h1>Take turns to place a stone on the board</h1>
    <p>In Go, both players take turns to place a stone on the board.</p>
    <p>Unlike chess, you place stones on the points where the lines cross, not in the spaces between them.</p>
    <p>Also, once you place a stone, you can't move it. Try it out:</p>
<div id="placing-stones"/>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Surround stones to capture them</h1>
    <p>Each point on the board is connected by lines to 2, 3 or 4 other points (depending on if it is a corner, side, or middle point). If any of those connecting points are empty, each one counts as one <em>liberty</em> for that stone.</p>
    <p>You can take away a liberty of an opponent's stone by placing a stone on it.</p>
    <p>When an opponent's stone has no liberties unfilled, you've captured it, and you remove the captured stone from the board.</p>
    <div id="liberties"/>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Connected stones are harder to capture</h1>
    <p>Stones connect with neighboring stones of the same color.</p>
    <p>When stones connect, they share liberties, so you need to surround the whole group to capture the stones, rather than surrounding one at a time.</p>
    <div id="liberties2"/>

<h1>How to play Go</h1>
<section>
<p>Go is a 2-player strategy game with a few simple rules.</p>
<p>One player takes black stones, and the other takes white. The black player goes first, unless there is a handicap.</p>
<p>In this interactive tutorial, you'll be playing as black. Go is normally played on a 19x19 grid, but a smaller 9x9 grid is easier to start with.</p>

<section>
    <h1>Take turns to place a stone on the board</h1>
    <p>In Go, both players take turns to place a stone on the board.</p>
    <p>Unlike chess, you place stones on the points where the lines cross, not in the spaces between them.</p>
    <p>Also, once you place a stone, you can't move it. Try it out:</p>
<div id="placing-stones"/>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Surround stones to capture them</h1>
    <p>Each point on the board is connected by lines to 2, 3 or 4 other points. If any of those connecting points are empty, each one counts as one <em>liberty</em> for that stone.</p>
    <p>You can take away a liberty of an opponent's stone by placing a stone on it.</p>
    <p>When all of an opponent's stone liberties are filled, you've captured the stone, and you remove it from the board.</p>
    <div id="liberties"/>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Connected stones are harder to capture</h1>
    <p>Stones connect with neighboring stones of the same color.</p>
    <p>When stones connect, they share liberties, so you need to surround the whole group to capture the stones, rather than surrounding one at a time.</p>
    <div id="liberties2"/>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Surround areas to make territory</h1>
    <p>At the end of the game, the number of points you surround counts toward your score.</p>
    <p>With Chinese counting rules, your score is <em>number of stones of your colour on the board + number of points surrounded</em></p>
    <p>Japanese counting rules are slightly different but it doesn't change the game much.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Self-capture is not allowed (suicide rule)</h1>
    <p>You can't place a stone somewhere where it would have no liberties.</p>
    <p>But if you're placing a stone that captures a neighbouring group, that's ok: you count the number of liberties at the end of the turn.</em></p>
    <div id="suicide"/>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Positions can't repeat themselves (ko rule)</h1>
    <p>You can't make a move that would bring the board back to the state it was just in.</p>
    <p>Without this rule, there could be situations where the players could endlessly capture each others stones and the game would never end.</p>
    <p>A situation where a player can't capture a stone without breaking this rule is called a <em>ko</em>. The player has to play somewhere else first.
    <div id="ko"/>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>The game ends when both players pass or one player resigns</h1>
    <p>You can pass a move at any time. When both players pass consecutively, the player with the highest score wins.</p>
    <p>The white player usually gets a few bonus points - <em>komi</em> -  to compensate for black going first.

    <h1>Playing Go</h1>
    <p>Now you know the rules of the Go you can start playing some games. <a href="https://online-go.com/">OGS</a> is a good online server.</p>
    <p>It's a good idea to play for a while on a small board (9x9 or 13x13) before playing on a full sized board.</p>
    <p>Normally the weaker player starts the game with handicap stones on the board, so that both players have an equal chance of winning.</p>
    <p>When you've played some games you'll get a rank - this goes from around from 30 kyu (weakest) to 1 kyu, and then after after 1 kyu you have 1 dan, 2 dan... up to 9 dan (strongest).
    <p>The number of handicap stones should be equal to the difference in rank of the players, from 2 stones up to 9 stones. If it's only one difference, that player goes first as black, and white doesn't get komi.</p>
